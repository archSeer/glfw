= Introduction

This package contains ruby bindings for GLFW library[link]. It also
contains the GLFW library itself, due to the fact that the library
itself is small and generally not preinstalled on common operating systems.

GLFW[link] is a free, Open Source, portable framework for OpenGL application
development. In short, it is a single library providing a powerful,
portable API for otherwise operating system specific tasks such as
opening an OpenGL window, and reading keyboard, time, mouse and joystick
input.

Both the bindings and the GLFW library is licensed under opensource zlib/libpng[link] license.

Currently tested and supported systems are Linux, Mac OS X and Windows,
although any POSIX compatible system should work as well.

You can also install directly from gem (see below).

= Installation

You need installed ruby, as well as rake and mkrf(>0.20) (both can be
installed from gems). You probably would want to install ruby-opengl[link]
as well, although it is not required for the installation process itself.

You can install directly from gems by executing 'gem install ruby-glfw',
that also includes binary (precompiled) gem for Windows (so you don't need
a compiler), that is compatible with the one-click ruby installer[link].

= Usage and API

= Limitations

The threading API is not implemented, as ruby has its own threading API.

glfwGetProcAddress is also not implemented, use ruby-opengl functions instead
